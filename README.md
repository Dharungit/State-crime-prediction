# State Crime Prediction

This is my final project in AI intern at Gateway Solutions.

This project is about finding the best algorithm for prediciting the crimes.

# Algorithm Used
 - LinearRegrassion
 - DecisionTree Regression
 - Random Forest
 - KNN
 - SVM

# Results
The DecisionTree Regression Algorithm is the best fit to predict crimes in a state.
